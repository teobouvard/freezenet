	abstract="We present a computational technique for combatting junk mail in particular and controlling access to a shared resource in general. The main idea is to require a user to compute a moderately hard, but not intractable, function in order to gain access to the resource, thus preventing frivolous use. To this end we suggest several pricing functions, based on, respectively, extracting square roots modulo a prime, the Fiat-Shamir signature scheme, and the Ong-Schnorr-Shamir (cracked) signature scheme.",

	abstract="We formalize the notion of a proof of work (POW). In many cryptographic protocols, a prover seeks to convince a verifier that she possesses knowledge of a secret or that a certain mathematical relation holds true. By contrast, in a POW, a prover demonstrates to a verifier that she has performed a certain amount of computational work in a specified interval of time. POWs have served as the basis of a number of security protocols in the literature, but have hitherto lacked careful characterization. In this paper, we offer definitions treating the notion of a POW and related concepts.",
